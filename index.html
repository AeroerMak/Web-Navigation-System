        <p>For some time, I’ve been considering implementing a dynamic navigation system for the website, particularly for www.tec.edu.my. The reason is that it’s a very large website with 86 HTML pages.

            Using a dynamic header and footer navigation system would make it much easier and more efficient to update the website when needed. Initially, I thought of using React for this, but after three days of research, I found a simpler solution using a few lines of JavaScript. </p>
